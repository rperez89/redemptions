1Hive's Redemptions app allows Aragon organizations to grant their token holders the right to redeem tokens in exchange for a proportional share of the organizations treasury assets.

#### üê≤ Project stage: Rinkeby

The Redemptions app has been published to `open.aragonpm.eth` on the Rinkeby test network. If you experience any issues or are interested in contributing please see review our open [issues](https://github.com/1hive/redemptions/issues).

#### üö® Security review status: pre-audit

The code in this repo has not been audited.


## How to run Redemptions locally

First make sure that you have node, npm, and the Aragon CLI installed and working. Instructions on how to set that up can be found [here](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html). You'll also need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) or some kind of web wallet enabled to sign transactions in the browser.

Git clone this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1Hive/redemptions-app.git
```

Navigate into the `redemptions-app` directory.

```sh
cd redemptions-app
```

Install npm dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

Deploy a dao with Redemptions installed on your local environment.
```sh
npm run start:template
```

If everything is working correctly, your new DAO will be deployed and your browser will open http://localhost:3000/#/YOUR-DAO-ADDRESS. It should look something like this:

You will also see the configuration for your local deployment in the terminal. It should look something like this:

```sh
    Ethereum Node: ws://localhost:8545
    ENS registry: 0x5f6f7e8cc7346a11ca2def8f827b7a0b612c56a1
    APM registry: aragonpm.eth
    DAO address: YOUR-DAO-ADDRESS
```

Currently the only thing deployed on your local testnet is an Aragon DAO with the Redemption app. In a new terminal navigate to the `redemptions-app` directory. Then run this truffle script to deploy some token contracts to interact with.

```sh
npm run deploy-tokens YOUR-DAO-ADDRESS
```

If successful, you will have deployed contracts for ANT, DAI, OMG, and ETH to your local testnet. The terminal will then display the names of the tokens and their addresses on your local testnet. It should look something like this:

```sh
------------------------------------------------
ANT 0x129711C337489538cCcbc0EFf52098a46bCF0705 Balance: 40
DAI 0xBf61048590B6FAd46Fb446aA241fA33f7a22851b Balance: 100
OMG 0xC56a94cB177B297A9f4fe11781CE4E2eD1829f8B Balance: 14189
ETH 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Balance: 2
------------------------------------------------
```

Now if you navigate back to your browser (http://localhost:3000/#/YOUR-DAO-ADDRESS) you'll be able to open the Redemptions app and add one of these tokens to your locally deployed Redemptions app. 



## How to deploy Redemptions to an organization

Redemptions has been published to APM on rinkeby at `redemptions.open.aragonpm.eth`

To deploy to an organization you can use the [Aragon CLI](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html).

```sh
aragon dao install <dao-address> redemptions.open.aragonpm.eth --app-init-args <vault-address> <token-manager-address>
```

The Redemptions app must have the `TRANSFER_ROLE` permission on `Vault` and the `BURN_ROLE` permission on the `Token Manager`.


## Using Redemptions

The redemptions app allows organizations to add and remove tokens from a list of eligible tokens. When a user choses to redeem tokens they will receive a proportional share of all eligible tokens in the `Vault`.

### Redeeming tokens:

To redeem tokens, click on the redeem then use the slider to select how many tokens you would like to redeem. When satified with the amount, click redeem to confirm. You will be prompted to sign a message, then you will be able to confirm the transaction.

</p>

### Adding eligible vault token:

To add an eligble token click "Add Token", then enter the address of the token contract you would like to add.

### Removing eligible vault token:

To remove an eligble token, hover over the token you want to remove and click "Remove Token", then enter the address of the token contract you would like to remove.
