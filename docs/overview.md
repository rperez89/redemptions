### What is the Redemptions app?

An Aragon app that enables redeeming organizations tokens for organization assets.

The redemptions app allows your organization to create a vault that exchanges your native token for an underlying asset. For example, the 1Hive native token is HONEY, but often times organization members will want DAI or ETH. The redemptions vault allows BEEs to exchange the HONEY they earn by contributing to the hive for the underlying asset of the vault.
